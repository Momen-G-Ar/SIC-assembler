## General Information

This code simulate the operation of translating assembly code into machine code with SIC architecture

## Install and Run

-   Install git repository: `git clone https://github.com/Momen-G-Ar/SIC-Assembler.git`
-   Change the working directory to be the project directory: `cd SIC-Assembler`
-   Try to write your own tests
-   To run the assembler you should:
    -   Install Python3 on you computer
    -   NOTE: Don't delete the opcode file
    -   Specify the path of test you want to run: `example.asm`
    -   Specify the path of intermediate file: `intermediate-example.mdt`
    -   Specify the path of output file to write the machine code in it: `output.obj`
    -   Run the Program using the command:
        -   `python3 main.py example.asm intermediate-example.mdt output.obj`
